# Delivery Application 
This is my first mobile app after in have learnt java in my university, it actually works almost the same as "Glovo".
The principle is simple, imagine that there is a lot of stores that want to sell to customers via Internet and especially via mobile. So they will need an intermediate between them and the customers. I created this app the be the tool that connects the two of them.

The clients/customers can browse the list of different marchandises from the stores available on the app, and they havce the ability to save any article/good on their wishlist or cart. In addition, the customers can buy through the app and their goods will be delivered to their address.
